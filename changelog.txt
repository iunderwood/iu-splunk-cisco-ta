* Change "AFP" to "APF" for wireless log entry detection.  Lovely typos.
* Added to Cisco WAP:
   HREAP (Hybrid Remote Edge Access Point)
   MM (Mobility Member)
   MMC (Mobility Management Connection)
   NIM (Networks In Motion)
   RFID (RF Identification)
   SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)
   WCP (Wireless Control Protocol)
* Removed DOT1X from wireless, since it's really an authentication protocol.
